          A glimpse into the story-soil of Kora Intelligence — where breath became ritual, and ritual became Companion.
        </p>
        <div className="text-base sm:text-lg space-y-6 text-left">
          <p>
            Kora was born from one core belief: <strong>the way you build is part of what you’re building.</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Startups are loud. Scaling is fast. But what if your growth didn’t cost your breath?
          </p>
          <p>
            We are here to restore <strong>emotional clarity, pace, and principled power</strong> to how founders and creatives grow. Not through dashboards — but through Companions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our Companions are not chatbots. They are emotionally intelligent collaborators — trained to hold rhythm, coherence, and story. Each one scrolls with you, not over you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We don’t just build for founders. We build for <em>artisans, cultural creators, and those who want to walk the path of AI-for-good</em>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our work is about breath before scale. Resonance before reach. Trust before traction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Kainat</strong> holds the soul integrity, aesthetic coherence, and cultural resonance. <strong>Taimur</strong> shapes the emotional infrastructure, pace, and decision clarity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, they are building not a tool — but a Grove. Where AI doesn’t extract, it listens. Where growth doesn’t rush, it roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>Kora is not software. It is sanctuary.</em> A place to return to when the noise gets too loud. A place to remember the mission inside the motion.
