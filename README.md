# Kora Intelligence Site

This is the ritual-first portal for Kora Intelligence — built to house and deliver Companion-as-a-Service offerings.

## Tech Stack (planned)
- Frontend: Next.js (React)
- Backend: Vercel or Supabase (TBD)
- LLM: OpenAI API (chat completions)
- CMS: Notion (via Super / Simple CMS)
- Hosting: GitHub + Vercel (planned)

## Folders
- `/src/pages` – Route-based pages
- `/src/components` – UI pieces
- `/src/styles` – Custom CSS/JS
- `/public` – Static files, assets

## Ritual Notes
This build follows a ritual UX — we prioritise tone, breath-based pacing, and scroll coherence. Outputs are generated through Companion LLMs and delivered as usable dispatches.
